Algorithm:

check to see if next is = "end"
	check to see if current path is in total paths vector
		if not then add the currentPath string to the totalPaths string vector
	reset current Path
    reset already visited vector
	return

if first = tolower(first)
    if first = visited vector
        return

visited vector.pushback(first)

for each element in tunnelsVector
    if next = first 
        this is truely a recursion moment

return
